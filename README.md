# Information System and Project Methodologies II - Project

This template repository is the starter project for Integrative Project in Information System and Project Methodologies II Project. Written in C#, and using Unity Framework.

### Project Description

In this project, you will work in teams to design, develop, and present a video game using Unity and C#. The project is divided into three deliverables: **Deliverable 0** (Project Proposal and Team Formation), **Deliverable 1** (60% of the Game), and **Deliverable 2** (Complete Game). The final product will include at least five design patterns, two core mechanics, and several other game features, including player interactions, visual/audio feedback, background music, and a splash screen.

The **entire project is worth 30% of your final grade**, and the grade distribution between the deliverables is as follows:
- **Deliverable 0 (Project Proposal + Team Formation)**: 5%
- **Deliverable 1 (60% of the Game)**: 10%
- **Deliverable 2 (Complete Game)**: 15%

### **Deliverables**

#### **Deliverable 0: Project Proposal + Team Formation**

The project proposal should summarize your game concept and provide an overview of your team and the game mechanics you plan to implement. The proposal should be **a maximum of 2 pages** and must include the following sections:

1. **Team Project Members** (1%)
   - List of team members and their roles (e.g., programmer, artist, designer).

2. **Game Information** (1%)
   - **Title**: The name of your game.
   - **Tagline**: A brief, catchy description of your game.
   - **Genre**: Action, adventure, puzzle, etc.
   - **Target Audience**: Who are you designing the game for (age, interest, etc.)?
   - **Goal**: What does the player aim to achieve in your game?

3. **Major Mechanics Descriptions** (1%)
   - Description of at least two core mechanics (such as movement, combat, collecting items, puzzle-solving).

4. **World/Level Design Draft** (1%)
   - Provide a rough draft or concept art of the game world or levels, including the layout, environments, and key elements.

5. **Task Breakdown for Next Deliverables** (1%)
   - For **Deliverable 1** and **Deliverable 2**, break down the tasks that need to be completed and assign team members to each task. Define deadlines for the tasks.

#### **Deliverable 1: 60% of the Game**  
**Worth 10% of Final Grade**

This deliverable focuses on implementing the first 60% of your game. You should aim to have the majority of your core mechanics, basic interactions, and at least one level in place. Deliverable 1 should include:

1. **Core Mechanics Implementation** (3%)
   - Implementation of at least **2 core mechanics** (e.g., movement, combat, collecting items, puzzle-solving).
   
2. **Design Patterns** (2%)
   - At least **3 design patterns** implemented (Singleton, Factory, Adapter, etc.).

3. **Player Interactions** (1%)
   - Interactions triggered by **player inputs** (e.g., using keyboard, mouse, or game controller).
   
4. **Visual and Audio Feedback** (2%)
   - **Visual feedback** (e.g., animation, effects) for player interactions.
   - **Audio feedback** (e.g., sounds when collecting items, character movement, collisions).
   
5. **Background Music** (1%)
   - **Background music** that plays throughout the game, either as ambient music or linked to different game states.
   
6. **Splash Screen** (1%)
   - **Splash screen** (a title screen or introductory screen) that appears when the game starts.

---

#### **Deliverable 2: Complete Game**  
*Due: [Insert Deadline]*  
**Worth 15% of Final Grade**

This final deliverable will include the remaining 40% of your game development. You must complete the following:

1. **Final Game Features** (5%)
   - Complete and integrate all core mechanics, interactions, and feedback.
   - Ensure everything works seamlessly (visual/audio feedback, mechanics, etc.).
   
2. **Design Patterns** (2%)
   - Include **5 design patterns** implemented throughout the game (e.g., Strategy, Observer, Command, State, etc.).

3. **User Interface and Menus** (2%)
   - Complete user interface elements (menus, HUD, etc.).

4. **Playtesting and Polishing** (2%)
   - Conduct playtesting to ensure the game is fun and free of major bugs.
   - Polish mechanics, visuals, and audio for a more refined experience.

5. **Teaser Video** (2%)
   - Create a **teaser video** showcasing your game. The video should demonstrate key mechanics, gameplay, and the visual style of the game.

6. **Project Presentation** (2%)
   - Present your game and provide a **PowerPoint presentation** (maximum 10 slides).
   - Highlight key sections of your **Game Design Document**.
   - Showcase your game through a **live demo** and reflect on your development process.

### **Game Design Document**

For **Deliverable 1**, you will submit a **Game Design Document (GDD)** that describes your game's details in-depth. The document should be **approximately 20-25 pages** and include the following sections:

1. **Executive Summary** (1 page max)
   - A brief overview of your game. Describe the world, the characters, the gameplay, and what the player needs to do to win.

2. **User Interface Mock-up(s)**
   - Visual representation of your game’s interface, including levels, menus, HUD, and flow between different screens.
   - These can be hand-drawn or created using tools like Figma, Sketch, or Photoshop.

3. **Controls**
   - A detailed description of how the player interacts with the game using the controller, keyboard, or mouse.
   - For example: "Press 'W' to move forward, 'Space' to jump."

4. **Design Patterns**
   - Explain the design patterns you are using in your game (at least 5) and how they are implemented.

5. **Tasks and Schedule Breakdown**
   - A list of tasks to implement the game, assigned to each team member.
   - Include deadlines for each task and the specific features each member will be responsible for.

6. **UML Diagrams**
   - At least three UML diagrams (e.g., Class Diagrams, Use Case Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams, etc.) to represent the structure and flow of your game.

---

### **Project Implementation**

- Your game code must meet the hard specifications outlined in the project handout.
- Code should be clean, well-commented, and structured according to good software design practices.
- The project should be developed using **Unity** and **C#**.
- The game should run smoothly, with all core mechanics and interactions properly implemented.

---

### **Project Presentation**  

At the end of the course, each team will present their game in a **10-minute presentation**. The presentation should be accompanied by a **PowerPoint** (maximum 10 slides) that covers:

1. **Game Design Document Highlights**
   - Present the key sections of your GDD (Executive Summary, UI Mock-ups, Controls, Design Patterns, and Tasks).

2. **Team Contributions**
   - Each team member should describe their primary contributions to the game development process. This may include coding, art, level design, etc.

3. **Live Demo of the Game**
   - Showcase your game in action. Highlight the core mechanics and interactions.
   - Discuss how you incorporated design patterns and how they contributed to the game design.

4. **Teaser Video**
   - Play the teaser video to demonstrate the game’s key mechanics, visuals, and gameplay.

5. **Learnings and Reflections**
   - Reflect on the development process. Discuss what went well, what challenges you encountered, and how you overcame them.
   - What improvements could be made to the game in the future?
